Minecraft is great game, but exploring always felt a bit boring.
There aren't many structures or dungeons you can explore and the ones you find, are getting repetitive.
We decided to spice things up a bit, by adding new dungeons and structures for you to explore.
By now 26 new dungeons and structures are included in our mod.
They all fit a medieval/fantasy theme and could fit along other fantasy or RPG-like Mods.
Some of our structures also look like they could be an upgraded version of a vanilla structure or a variant to them.
Get ready to find huge mazes under trees, castles, towers and forgotten temples.
We hope you have fun!
