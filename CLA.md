# Contributor License Agreement (Individual)

**Definitions.** A "Contribution" includes any code, documentation, or other material you submit via pull request, issue, email, or other channels. "Project" means the software and related materials contained in this repository.

**Copyright License.** You grant the Project maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Contribution, and to sublicense these rights.

**Patent License.** You grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contribution, alone or in combination with the Project, for any patent claims you own or control that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution. If you initiate patent litigation alleging that the Project or a Contribution infringes a patent, this patent license to you terminates as of the date litigation is filed.

**Moral Rights.** To the extent permitted by law, you waive and agree not to assert moral rights in your Contribution against the Project and its recipients.

**Outbound License.** You agree that your Contribution is licensed by the Project to the public under the same license as the Project. You also grant the Project maintainers the right to relicense your Contribution under a later version of that license or another OSI-approved open-source license.

**Representations.** You represent that (a) each Contribution is your original work or you have the right to submit it; (b) you are not aware of any third-party rights that would be infringed; (c) you did not include confidential or export-controlled information; and (d) if your employer has rights in your Contributions, you have received permission to submit them.

**No Additional Terms.** You agree not to impose additional terms or restrictions on the Project’s use of your Contribution.

**Indemnification**. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Project maintainers and authorized distributors of the Project from and against third-party claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of your breach of this agreement. The Project will promptly notify you of the claim and reasonably cooperate at your expense. This clause does not require you to indemnify for modifications made by the Project after acceptance that you did not author.

**Attribution.** The Project will include your name, username and E-Mail as part of the commit history. You may indicate a preferred form of credit; however, attribution is at the Project’s discretion and creates no enforceable rights.

This is the entire agreement regarding Contributions. It does not create a partnership or employment relationship. If any provision is unenforceable, the rest remains in effect. This agreement may be accepted electronically (including by submitting a Contribution).
