## 4.0
* ported to 1.19.2
* updated config as BiomeDictionary got removed (needs more testing)
* jigsaw structures no longer have access to the terrain analyzer as they got hard-coded (we and structure gel already work on a solution)
* increased Monster Maze size again thanks to Structure Gels ExtrendedJigsawStructure
